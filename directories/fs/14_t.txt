The Organization

In ArtculatePHP folder, there are four folders and boot-strapper file, index.php:

1.	config – It keeps a file called project.class.php. This php file initializes the template object, database connection object and other project configuration objects and references for the included files that are required to be loaded during project initialization.

2.	data --- This folder keeps the php class library files for database access.

3.	interface – Interface folder keeps the template files required for the view layer. It also keeps the CSS files and Images

4.	libs – This folder keeps the class libraries and functions required.
5.	scripts – This folder keeps all kinds of third party javascript, css and php files and folders.


The index.php file is at the root of the project folder that acts as bootstrapper. All requests to the pages of a website are directed to this page. Moreover according to this framework all POST and GET requests are processed by individual controller pages kept in the parent directory and not redirected to the index.php file.

This simplified design has been very helpful for any small or large scale website project development. Websites such as www.articulatelogic.com, www.conveylive.com are exclusively developed using this framework. We are very hopeful that this framework will prove to be very useful for all PHP MySQL developers.
